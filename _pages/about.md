THANKS FOR STOPPING BY! THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION! PLEASE COME BACK LATER FOR UPDATED INFORMATION ABOUT ME.

I am an Assistant Professor at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/) in the department of Mechanical Engineering. I teach a wide variety of classes, mainly programming classes, Mechatronics, and Control Systems (more details in the [teaching tab](/teaching)). 

My research interests lie in the fields of microrobotics and micromanipulation, especially when targeted for biomedical applications. My collaborators and I have worked on a multiple different microrobotic systems, which include real-time micro-force sensing, *in-vivo* actuation and motion, and targeted drug delivery. 

If you are interested in learning more about my work, feel free to contact me.
