I am an Assistant Professor at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/) in the department of Mechanical Engineering. I teach a wide variety of classes, mainly programming classes, Mechatronics, and Control Systems (more details in the [teaching tab](/teaching)). 

My research interests lie in the fields of microrobotics and micromanipulation, especially when targeted for biomedical applications. My collaborators and I have worked on a multiple different microrobotic systems, which include real-time micro-force sensing, *in-vivo* actuation and motion, and targeted drug delivery. I'm highly interested in developing new microrobots using novel fabrication methods and utilizing computer vision algorithms to elevate their potential and impact. 

If you are interested in learning more about my work, feel free to contact me.
