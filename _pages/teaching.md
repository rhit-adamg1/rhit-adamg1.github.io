#### ME123 - Computer Programming
Software tools and engineering processes for mechanical engineers. Topics may include: structured programming (Matlab), simulation of rigid body motion, presentation software, and spreadsheets. Introduction to teaming and creativity.

#### EM103 - Introduction to Design
Introduces the engineering design process including problem definition, analysis, alternate solutions, specifications of final solution, and techniques of oral and written communications. Stresses the importance of teamwork through group design efforts.

#### ES201 - Conservation & Accounting Principles
A common framework for engineering analysis is developed using the concepts of a system, accounting and conservation of extensive properties, constitutive relations, constraints, and modeling assumptions. Conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy, and an entropy accounting equation are developed. Applications taken from all engineering disciplines stress constructing solutions from basic principles.

#### ME327 - Numerical Methods of Engineering Analysis
This is an inter-disciplinary course focusing on the generation and interpretation of numerical solutions and the processing of numerical data for engineering problems. Topics include approximate solutions to nonlinear algebraic and differential equations, initial and boundary value problems, numerical integration and differentiation, optimization, data conditioning, and regression analysis. Trade-offs between accuracy and cost are emphasized. Matlab is used as the programming language.

#### ME406 - Control Systems
Basic principles of feedback control theory. Mathematical modeling and performance analysis of dynamical systems. Includes stability analysis, root locus compensation and design, and frequency response analysis. Implementation of control system analysis and design is gained with several laboratory experiences. 

#### ME430 - Mechatronic Systems
Applications of microprocessors and microcontrollers and digital electronics to the design and utilizations of embedded control systems in smart systems and products. Topics include Boolean logic and algebra, system hardware and software development, and interfacing for mechanical applications.
