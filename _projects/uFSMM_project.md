The micro-force sensing magnetic mobile microrobot  (μFSMM) is a microrobot targeted for *in-vitro* uses, especially for biomedical and micromanipulation applications. The microrobot is equipped with an on-board vision-based micro-force sensor, capable of real-time force sensing and sub-μN resolution. Additionally, the μFSMM is actuated using in-plane gradient magnetic fields, provided by 2 pairs of co-planar electromagnetic coils.
